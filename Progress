Day 1:
Built the circuit.
Making sure the circuit works:
  1) Protection circuit:
    Goal: It should make ground any voltage that is greater than 0.4V. 
    Test: Plugged in 5V to the electrode side and measured 0.3V on the end going to the circuit. I also plugged in 5V in from the circuit side and measured 1.3V going to the electrode
    Result: Not working as expected
  2)Instrumentation Amplifer 
    Goal: If plugged in correctly, it should give a gain of 26
    Test: Input of 0.1V and measured ~2.5V output
    Result: Plugged in correctly and working
  3) High Pass Filter
    Goal: Filter out DC offset
    Test: Plugged in DC 5V and measured  0.02V at the output
    Result: success
  4)Inverting Op Amp
    Goal: Amplify by 100x
    Test: Plug in DC 0.09V and measured 7.82V
    Result: pretty successful
  5)Low Pass Filter: did not test because the process involves complicated code to make Arduino into a Function Generator and Oscilloscope. 



Software update:
  1. copied the main code chucks from the EEG guys, this is now part of main code 'read_serial.m'. 
  2. created 'predict.m' which predict state based on logistical regression output.
  3. created 'waveAnalyze.m' which filter wave based on three wave band and output three index representing mean intensity of the three waves
  4. created 'sigmoid.m' which calculate the logistic regression model probability.
  5. Hardware Wiring Diagram is the LT spice file of hardware drawing
