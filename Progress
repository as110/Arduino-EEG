Day 1:
Built the circuit.
Making sure the circuit works:
  1) Protection circuit:
    Goal: It should make ground any voltage that is greater than 0.4V. 
    Test: Plugged in 5V to the electrode side and measured 0.3V on the end going to the circuit. I also plugged in 5V in from the circuit side and measured 1.3V going to the electrode
    Result: Not working as expected
  2) Instrumentation Amplifer 
    Goal: If plugged in correctly, it should give a gain of 26
    Test: Input of 0.1V and measured ~2.5V output
    Result: Plugged in correctly and working
  3) High Pass Filter
    Goal: Filter out DC offset
    Test: Plugged in DC 5V and measured  0.02V at the output
    Result: success
  4)Inverting Op Amp
